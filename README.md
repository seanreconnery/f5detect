# f5detect
Allows a user to run StegDetect's F5 deep analysis function thru a web interface and returns the results as JSON.

On your server, make sure StegDetect is installed.

git clone https://github.com/abeluck/stegdetect.git

linux32 ./configure

linux32 make


Then you can:  pip install flask

and you're pretty much set (minus the whole making sure your file structure is setup proper.)
